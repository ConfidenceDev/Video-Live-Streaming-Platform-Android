    <string name="help1">INFO: Vebbo is a free live streaming platform, bringing people together by providing short video streams.\n\n</string>
    <string name="help2">HOW IT WORKS: 1. Click on the \"Tv\" button to start a stream, end at any time by clicking the \"End\" button.
        \n\n2. The stream counter shows your position and if you are next to stream, the server automatically selects the next stream.
        \nYou can stream for 5 min for free or add more time by paying a little token.
        \n\n3. You can drop a note for everyone online to see by clicking the \"Add Note\" button at the bottom right corner when streaming.
        \n\nNOTE: If reported more than the set threshold, your stream will be terminated and/or your device will be blocked from starting a new stream,
        so avoid any illicit or inappropriate behaviours. \n\n</string>
    <string name="help3">By using Vebbo you agree to our terms of service (See Settings).
